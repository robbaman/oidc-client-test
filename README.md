# oidc-client-test

Test for oidc-client-js TypeScript typings. Just clone the repo and run the commands `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

If all goes well, all typings and required packages are installed, a TypeScript compilation is run and a tiny http server is started at `localhost:8080`

Browse there and you should see a message that *UserManager is of type function*
